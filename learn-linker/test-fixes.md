# Testing Guide for Streaming and Snippet Viewing Fixes

## What was fixed:

### 1. Streaming Explanation Issue ✅
**Problem**: AI explanations weren't showing in the webview, only the selected code was visible.
**Root Cause**: CommandHandlerV2 was using `appendContent` instead of proper streaming messages.
**Fix**: Now uses `panel.streamContent()` which sends correct `streamStart`, `streamChunk`, and `streamEnd` messages.

### 2. Snippet Viewing Issue ✅  
**Problem**: Clicking on snippets in collection showed "Snippet not found" error.
**Root Cause**: Was using text search instead of ID lookup.
**Fix**: Added `getSnippet(id)` method and fixed the lookup logic.

## Test Steps:

### Test 1: Streaming Explanation
1. **Select code** in any file (a few lines)
2. **Right-click** → "Learn Linker: Explain Selection"
3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Should see "Explaining code..." progress notification
   - ✅ Webview panel opens beside editor
   - ✅ Should see streaming indicators (dots or loading animation)
   - ✅ AI explanation should appear progressively (streaming)
   - ✅ Explanation should be properly formatted with markdown

### Test 2: Save and View Snippets
1. **After explanation appears**, click "Save to Collection" in the message
2. **Add a note** when prompted (optional)
3. **Open Command Palette** (Cmd+Shift+P)
4. **Run** "Learn Linker: Show Snippet Collection"
5. **Click on any snippet** in the collection
6. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Collection shows all saved snippets
   - ✅ Clicking a snippet opens it without errors
   - ✅ Snippet details show code, explanation, and notes

### Test 3: Export Verification
1. **Run** "Learn Linker: Export Snippets" 
2. **Choose Markdown format**
3. **Open the exported file**
4. **Expected**: Should contain all data (code, explanation, notes)

## Success Indicators:
- ✅ No "Cannot find snippet" errors
- ✅ AI explanations stream properly in webview
- ✅ Individual snippets can be viewed from collection
- ✅ All data is preserved (code, explanation, notes)

## Debugging if Issues Persist:
1. Open Developer Tools: Help → Toggle Developer Tools
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Check Output panel → "Learn Linker" channel
4. Reload VS Code window: Cmd+R in Developer Tools
